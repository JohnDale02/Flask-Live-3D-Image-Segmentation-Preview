# Flask-Live-3D-Image-Segmentation-Preview
This Flask application allows users to upload images, and preview the physical representation of the end product in 3D. These signs involve separating an image into many layers, a form of image segmentation, and physically separating the layers in 3D to create a neat illusion when viewed from different angles.
